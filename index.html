		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<img src="http://lorempixel.com/200/200" class="mainpic">
		<p>My name is Sofiane, I am originally from Algeria and moved to the Bay Area about 4 years ago.</p> 

		<p>I hold a BA in Computer Science and currently pursuing an AA in International Marketing. I wanted to have some background in marketing because it is needed and much more helpful to promote any product when understanding the integraded communication that occurs between the product and its consumer. However, I've always wanted to operate my own business and hopefully one day i will reach my goal.</p>  

		<p>Learning, traveling, exploring is my a passion of mine that made me cross the Atlantic Ocean:). In my spare (which I barely have now!) I enjoy playing basketball, soccer or even sometimes I will be in the mood of kicking a tennis ball. But Spending quality time with family and close friends is always my priority. </p>
